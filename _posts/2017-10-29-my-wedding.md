Getting married was a day I dreamt about since a little girl. The day finally came when Kyle proposed to me with a showstopper marquise sapphire and diamond ring in July, with Mussenden Temple as a backdrop. Kyle had thought of every detail, life was prefect in my world. A feeling I will never forget.

Now the planning, stressing, saving and trying to make decisions had commenced.

Kyle and I got married on the 12th May 2015 at Ballydugan Mill in Downpatrick Co. Down Northern Ireland. From the outset I knew exactly how I wanted my wedding to look. For further inspiration and someone to keep me on the right track, I met up with my very special friend Louise at The Vintage Room. Who owns a styling company and highly skilled at co-ordinating unique weddings. [Check out her blog](http://www.thevintageroom.info/)

I felt I would never wear a traditional ivory wedding dress, as I wanted that ‘something different’. My mother in law recommended a very talented designer (Elizabeth Francis) . My first consolation with Elizabeth was such a wonderful experience, her and I just clicked she was able to get into my head, and have the vision to design what I wanted.
My Wedding dress was dutchess satin with a fitted top layer of French lace in an antique rose shade highlighted with sequins and pearls.Bridesmaids in ivory crepe silk with separate French lace tops in the same design as the bride. Waists highlighted with deep satin ribbon bow belts.
