Where has the summer gone?
This may be a slightly depressing blog post for reader and writer alike. As its about our summer holiday to Bermuda and New York.

Our first stop was Bermauda staying with friends for 9 nights. Kyle had been on many occasions before, and talked about it often I felt I had been. After flying 10hrs we arrived feeling fresh and ready to attack the day as we flew first class, with British Airways. What an amazing flying and dining experience.

From the outset Bermuda was truly **breathe taking**, high temperatures, and the beaches with its pink sand and exceptionally clear water.  In such a beautiful country It was a honour to be hosted by wonderful friends.

Initially I didn't think there would be much to do in Bermuda but I was proved wrong. Firstly the Americaâ€™s Cup was on while we where there, what an experience to watch New Zealand and America compete in the final.  

There are so many beautiful bays to relax on a lounger basking the high temperatures eating chilled fruit and salty crisps.

 We also visited the Crystal Caves of Bermuda, a tourist attraction since 1907 discovered by two teenagers in 1905. Deep, Clear underground pools of azure blue water. Incredible formations of every size and shape imaginable. Deep, clear underground pools of azure blue water. Incredible formations of water.

Another day of the trip we rented a boat filled it with goodies and went out to sea. Swimming with fish and meeting up with friends. 
So many wonderful things to do and experience in Bermuada I couldn't write about them all. If you ever have the opportunity to visit this beautiful island, you will then understand what I mean, about it's breathtaking views and bays.

After spending 10 days in Bermuda one extra night, as our flight was cancelled.  We then flew onto New York, which was a lifetime experience.  I will get round to writing about it soon, stay tuned, for another blog post. 

Thanks for reading
